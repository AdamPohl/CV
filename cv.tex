\section{\centerline{Relevent Skills}}
\vspace{8pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Communication and Interpersonal} \\
Having worked for a retail company for the last five years I feel that these
skills have vastly improved as I have had to engage with the customer every
weekend and always make sure that I give them the best service I can. \\

\item \textbf{Analytical and Problem solving} \\
Through doing a maths degree, I have been able to hone these skills, be it my
analytical skills in modules such as analysis or computing for maths, or my
problem solving skills in my maths degree as a whole.

\item \textbf{Team work} \\
One of the pieces of coursework in Computing for Maths was that we had to do a
group project. We were able to achieve a score of 86\% as we utilised our
strengths to their best advantage.  This has allowed me to better appreciate
working in a good team rather than on my own as it allows you to concentrate on
just one part of the project, rather than the whole thing, and make that as good
as it can be.

\item \textbf{Leadership} \\
When I did Young Engineers, I was the leader of my group and helped us to become
the best team in Wales that year by only dropping two marks overall, the best
team in the UK only dropped one mark, and win the award for best presentation.
At TK Maxx I quite often have to run the tills and look after/teach the new
people on the tills

\item \textbf{IT/Computing} \\
In completing the ‘Computing for Mathematics’ module, I have learnt how to code
in python and also how to write maths in LaTeX. I found this to be very
enjoyable and as computers are an essential part of any business, I feel that
being able to code is a valuable knowledge to have. \\
\\
Last year I undertook the ‘Introduction to Computational Statistics’ module in
which I am learnt how to code in R and use it as a software environment to do
statistical computing/analysis. \\
\\
I am a contributor to various open source software packages used by the
international programming community: git-control and script (for use with the
Atom editor). I contribute to these projects through modern software development
tools and practices including git and github.

\item \textbf{Business and Commercial Awareness} \\
Having worked in retail for the past four years, I feel that I have gained a
good commercial awareness as I have had to make sure that whatever part of the
store I was in, it was always neat and tidy as to make it more appealing to the
customer. It has also given me a better business awareness as we have regular
meetings about how the business is doing, be it my store or TJX Europe, and how
what I do on the shop floor can help the business to grow.
