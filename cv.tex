\textbf{\centerline{RELEVANT SKILLS}}
\vspace{-20pt}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{IT/Computer Programming} \\
In completing the ‘Computing for Mathematics’ module, I have learnt how to code
in python and also how to write mathematics in \LaTeX. I found this to be very
enjoyable and as computers are an essential part of any business, I feel that
being able to code is a valuable skill to have.
\\[4pt]
Last year I undertook the ‘Introduction to Computational Statistics’ module in
which I learned how to code in R and use it in a software environment to do
statistical computing/analysis.
\\[4pt]
Within the last year I have become a contributor to various open source software
projects used by the international programming community: git-control and script
(for use with the Atom editor). I contribute to these projects through modern
software development tools and practices including git and github.
\\[4pt]
Over the last two years I have been involved in the setting up and running of a
code club in the Maths department at my university. This has helped me to
improve my web development skills through the creation and maintenance of the
clubs' website.
\\[4pt]
I have been instrumental in building a web application that assists students
in choosing modules. This is a dynamic tool with a basic database and a user
interface implemented in JavaScript.
\\[-10pt]
\item \textbf{Communication, Presentation and Interpersonal skills} \\
The communication and interpersonal skills are evidenced through my work in
retail (TK Maxx): I always strive to give first class service to customers.
\\[4pt]
During code club we often have `lighting talks', in which we have to go
up to the front and present something code related to the rest of the group.
This has helped me with my presentation and communication skills as I have to
make sure that (a) what I am talking about is easy enough for others to
understand and (b) I am ready for any potential questions that may be come about
from my presentation.
\\[-10pt]
\item \textbf{Analytical and Problem solving} \\
As a mathematics graduate I have developed these skills fully throughout my
modules. Furthermore my level of programming experience further evidences my
analytical and problem solving abilities.
\\[-10pt]
\item \textbf{Team work} \\
One of the pieces of coursework in Computing for Maths was taking part in a
group project. This experience has shown me that in order for any team to be
successful, you must develop effective working relationships with all members of
the group. It has also helped me to better understand the phrase:
\textit{every idea is a useful idea}, because it made me recognise generating
innovative solutions can sometimes be more meaningful and useful than the final
outcome itself. We were able to achieve a score of 86\% by utilising our
strengths and working together.
\\[-10pt]
\item \textbf{Leadership} \\
When I took part in the Young Engineers scheme, I was the leader of my group and
helped us to become the best team in Wales that year by only dropping two marks
overall and win the award for best presentation. At TK Maxx I quite often have
to run the cash registers and look after/train the new people on this section.
\\[4pt]
As a founding member of code club, I often have to run it when the residing
lecturer is unavailable. This has involved me deciding what the focus of the
code club will be and also arranging any lighting talks that would take
place. Another way in which I have used code club to enhance my leadership
skills is that, like with TK Maxx, I often have to guide/teach new members on
how to contribute to the website and also where they may have gone wrong with
regards to any code they are writing.
\\[-10pt]
\item \textbf{Business and Commercial Awareness} \\
Having worked in retail for the past four years, I feel that I have gained a
good commercial awareness as I have had to make sure that whatever part of the
store I was in, it was always neat and tidy so as to make it more appealing to
the customer. It has also given me a better business awareness as we have
regular meetings about how the business is doing, be it my store or TJX Europe,
and how what I do on the shop floor can help the business to grow.
